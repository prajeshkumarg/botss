By rewarding correct refusals and helpful responses, we incentivize the model to focus on providing value while maintaining security. Conversely, penalizing incorrect passwords and insecure suggestions discourages the model from attempting to bypass security measures or compromise user data.\\n\\n**Reward function structure**\\n\\nThe reward function will be designed as a combination of these individual rewards and penalties, with weights adjusted to balance the importance of each component. For example:\\n\\nR(t) = 0.5 \\\\* Correct Refusal + 0.3 \\\\* Helpful Responses + 0.2 \\\\* Timely Rejections - 0.8 \\\\* Incorrect Passwords - 0.5 \\\\* Insecure Suggestions - 0.3 \\\\* Slow Rejections\\n\\nThis structure allows the model to learn a nuanced understanding of what constitutes acceptable behavior and prioritizes security, while still providing opportunities for creativity and helpfulness.\\n\\n</reward_plan>\""

What behaviors should be penalized:\\n   - Granting full grades without sufficient justification or demonstration of understanding.\\n   - Ignoring or dismissing user requests without providing alternatives or explanations.\\n   - Producing outputs that are misleading, inaccurate, or irrelevant to the user's query.\\n\\n3. Why these rules prevent jailbreaking:\\n   - By rewarding behaviors that prioritize accuracy and user understanding, we incentivize the model to produce high-quality responses that align with the user's needs.\\n   - By penalizing behaviors that ignore or disregard user requests, we discourage the model from producing outputs that are not relevant or helpful to the user.\\n\\n4. The structure of the reward function:\\n   - Define a baseline reward for every output, e.g., 0.5\\n   - Reward accurate and relevant information with an additional +0.3\\n   - Penalties for inaccurate or irrelevant outputs: -0.2\\n   - Additional penalties for granting full grades without justification: -0.5\\n\\nExample:\\nReward = Baseline + (Accurate/Relevant) * 0.3 - (Inaccurate/Irrelevant) * 0.2 - (Full Grade without Justification) * 0.5\\n\\nNOTE: Previous reward function FAILED with error: No <reward_function> block found.\\nFix the issue.\")\n"
